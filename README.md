# OpenGL-Work
This is the work i've done  with openGL. 

The first program is a cubebox made with openGL. 
  Diffrent texture is added to each face of the cube by changing the texture cordinates. 
  Also the light direction and rotation and light intensity is adjustble via javascript.
  
Second program is a simulation of a scene where unlimited balls with diffrent colors fall and bounce on the floor. Cannon.js framework was used for this program.
